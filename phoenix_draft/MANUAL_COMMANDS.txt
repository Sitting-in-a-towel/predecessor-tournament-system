=== MANUAL PHOENIX STARTUP COMMANDS ===

Since batch files keep closing, copy and paste these commands one by one into Command Prompt:

1. Open Command Prompt (Windows + R, type "cmd", press Enter)

2. Navigate to Phoenix directory:
cd "H:\Project Folder\Predecessor website\phoenix_draft"

3. Set the PATH:
set PATH=C:\Program Files\Erlang OTP\bin;C:\Program Files\Elixir\bin;%PATH%

4. Clean problematic dependency:
mix deps.clean bcrypt_elixir

5. Get dependencies:
mix deps.get

6. Compile project:
mix compile

7. Start Phoenix server:
mix phx.server

=== EXPECTED RESULT ===
You should see:
[info] Running PredecessorDraftWeb.Endpoint with cowboy
[info] Access PredecessorDraftWeb.Endpoint at http://localhost:4000

Then test: http://localhost:4000

=== IF STILL ERRORS ===
The Command Prompt will show the exact error message.
Take a screenshot or copy the error text.
