## üí¨ EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION PATTERNS

### ‚úÖ GOOD Issue Reports:
```
"I'm logged in as admin (username: sitting_in_a_towel visible in top right). 
When I publish a bracket in 'test admin panel' tournament, I get two error messages:
1. 'Failed to save bracket data. Please try again.'  
2. 'Failed to publish bracket - please try again'
The bracket appears published but disappears after refreshing the page.
Screenshot attached showing both error messages."
```

### ‚ùå BAD Issue Reports:
```
"Brackets don't work. It's broken."
"Same error as before."
"Still not working after your fix."
```

### Communication Tips:
- **Be specific** - Exact text, exact actions, exact results
- **Include context** - Authentication status, user role, tournament name
- **Show don't tell** - Screenshots are worth thousands of words
- **Test before reporting** - Try basic troubleshooting first

## üéØ FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION

### If Asked for More Details:
- [ ] **Backend logs** - I might ask you to help gather server logs
- [ ] **Try specific tests** - I might ask you to test specific scenarios
- [ ] **Verify fixes** - I'll ask you to confirm when issues are resolved
- [ ] **Additional screenshots** - More specific views of the problem

### Working Together Efficiently:

- **Confirm when working** - Let me know when issues are resolved
- **Report side effects** - If my fix breaks something else

## üèÜ SUCCESS PATTERN

**The bracket persistence issue was resolved quickly because:**
1. User clearly stated authentication status ("I'm logged in")
2. User provided specific error messages (exact text of both errors)  
3. User provided screenshot showing both error messages simultaneously
4. User tested immediately after fix was applied
5. User confirmed when issue was resolved

**This pattern gets issues fixed fast and prevents back-and-forth confusion.**

**Remember: The more specific and complete your initial report, the faster we can identify and fix the root cause!**
