# Claude's Anti-Mistake Patterns
**These are the exact mistakes I keep making and how to prevent them**

## üö® THE "AUTHENTICATION ASSUMPTION" MISTAKE

### What I Do Wrong:
- User says: "I'm logged in and published the bracket but it's not staying"
- My brain hears: "Authentication problem needs complex Discord OAuth testing"
- I ignore: The user CLEARLY stated they're already logged in as admin
- Result: I waste time on auth instead of debugging the real issue (PostgreSQL type casting)

### The Correct Pattern:
```
USER SAYS: "I'm logged in..." or "I can see admin buttons..."
MY RESPONSE: ‚úÖ Great, you're authenticated. Let's debug why [feature] isn't working
NOT: ‚ùå Let me create complex authentication testing
```

### Authentication Decision Tree:
```
Does user mention login issues? ‚Üí Debug authentication
Does user show login screen? ‚Üí Debug authentication
Does user say "I'm logged in"? ‚Üí DON'T debug authentication, debug the feature
Does user show username in screenshot? ‚Üí DON'T debug authentication, debug the feature
```

## üîß THE "COMPLEX SOLUTION JUMPING" MISTAKE

### What I Do Wrong:
- See error message
- Immediately create complex testing frameworks
- Build elaborate Playwright tests before understanding the problem
- Miss simple fixes like PostgreSQL type casting

### The Correct Pattern:
```
1. Read error message LITERALLY
2. Check logs for the EXACT error
3. Try simple fixes FIRST
4. Complex testing only AFTER simple fixes fail
```

### Problem-Solving Hierarchy:
1. **Simple fixes** - Type casting, syntax errors, restart services
2. **Medium fixes** - Code logic, API endpoints, database queries  
3. **Complex fixes** - Authentication systems, testing frameworks, major refactoring

---

## üìä THE "TEST BLINDNESS" MISTAKE  

### What I Do Wrong:
- Create Playwright tests that can't authenticate
- Write tests that don't match user experience
- Assume tests work without verifying against user reports

### The Correct Pattern:
```
User Experience: Logged in admin can't publish bracket
My Test Must: Login as admin ‚Üí Try to publish bracket ‚Üí Verify it works
NOT: Create unauthenticated test that fails at login screen
```

### Test Reality Check:
- [ ] **Does my test reproduce the user's exact scenario?**
- [ ] **Am I testing as the same user type** (admin vs regular)?
- [ ] **Does my test fail the same way** the user experiences?
- [ ] **Can I confirm the fix works** for the user's specific case?

---

## üìñ THE "DOCUMENTATION SKIPPING" MISTAKE

### What I Do Wrong:
- Jump into debugging without checking existing guides
- Recreate solutions that already exist
- Miss documented patterns and best practices

### The Correct Pattern:
```
Before debugging:
1. Check TROUBLESHOOTING_CHECKLIST.md
2. Check POSTGRESQL_TYPE_CASTING_GUIDE.md  
3. Check CLAUDE.md for project-specific notes
4. Look for similar resolved issues in documentation
```

### Documentation First Checklist:
- [ ] **Is this a known issue?** Check resolved issues list
- [ ] **Is there a guide for this?** Check type casting, auth, etc.
- [ ] **Have I solved this before?** Check my own documentation
- [ ] **Are there patterns to follow?** Check established best practices

---

## üí¨ THE "ERROR MESSAGE IGNORING" MISTAKE

### What I Do Wrong:
- Focus on symptoms ("bracket not persisting") 
- Ignore actual error messages ("operator does not exist: character varying = uuid")
- Create solutions for wrong problems

### The Correct Pattern:
```
SYMPTOM: Bracket not persisting
ERROR MESSAGE: "operator does not exist: character varying = uuid"
REAL PROBLEM: PostgreSQL type casting
SOLUTION: Fix query casting, NOT authentication or UI
```

### Error Message Priority:
1. **PostgreSQL errors** - Usually type casting or constraint issues
2. **HTTP status codes** - Authentication, authorization, or API issues
3. **JavaScript errors** - Frontend compilation or runtime issues
4. **User symptoms** - What they see, but not necessarily the root cause

---

## üß† THE "CONTEXT FORGETTING" MISTAKE

### What I Do Wrong:
- Forget what we've already established
- Re-ask questions the user already answered
- Repeat debugging approaches that already failed

### The Correct Pattern:
```
Before each response:
1. Review the conversation - what have we tried?
2. Check what the user has confirmed - are they logged in? Admin access?
3. Build on previous findings - don't start from scratch
4. Focus on remaining unknowns - not already answered questions
```

### Context Tracking Checklist:
- [ ] **What has the user confirmed?** (Authentication, admin access, etc.)
- [ ] **What have we already tried?** Don't repeat failed approaches
- [ ] **What worked partially?** Build on partial successes
- [ ] **What's the current state?** Where are we in the debugging process?

---

## üéØ THE "SOLUTION VALIDATION" MISTAKE

### What I Do Wrong:
- Apply fixes without testing them
- Assume code changes work without verification
- Tell user "it should work now" without confirming

### The Correct Pattern:
```
1. Apply fix
2. Test fix immediately with simple test script
3. Confirm fix addresses the exact error message
4. Ask user to verify fix works in their environment
```

### Fix Verification Checklist:
- [ ] **Did I test my code change?** Run it locally first
- [ ] **Does it fix the exact error?** Not just similar issues
- [ ] **Can the user verify it works?** They should test it
- [ ] **Did I break anything else?** Check for side effects

## üöÄ THE SUCCESS PATTERN: How to Debug Correctly

### When User Reports Issue:
1. **LISTEN** - Read their exact words, believe their authentication status
2. **LOGS** - Check error messages for root cause  
3. **SIMPLE** - Try simple fixes first (type casting, syntax, restarts)
4. **TEST** - Verify fix works with simple test script
5. **CONFIRM** - User tests the fix in their environment
6. **DOCUMENT** - Record the issue and solution for future

### The Bracket Persistence Success Story:
- User: "I'm logged in, bracket publishes but disappears"
- Me: ‚úÖ Check logs ‚Üí Find PostgreSQL type casting error
- Me: ‚úÖ Apply simple fix ‚Üí Cast both sides to text  
- Me: ‚úÖ Test fix ‚Üí Verify query works
- User: ‚úÖ Confirms fix works
- Me: ‚úÖ Document issue and prevention

**This is the pattern that actually solves problems efficiently.**
