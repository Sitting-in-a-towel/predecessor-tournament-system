## Recommendations Based on Your Airtable Experience

### For Starting Out (0-1000 users)
**Recommended: Netlify + Render**
- Why: Most generous free tiers, easiest setup
- Watch out for: Database suspension after 90 days
- When to upgrade: When you hit 80% of bandwidth or need reliable database

### For Growth Phase (1000-10,000 users)
**Recommended: Vercel + Supabase or Self-hosted**
- Why: Better scalability, more features
- Watch out for: Database size limits
- When to upgrade: When approaching 50K MAU or 500MB database

### For Scale (10,000+ users)
**Recommended: Self-hosted or Fly.io**
- Why: Cost-effective at scale, full control
- Watch out for: Management overhead
- Budget: $20-50/month for good VPS

## Key Metrics to Monitor (Avoid Airtable Situation)

1. **Database Size**: Check weekly
   ```sql
   SELECT pg_database_size('your_db_name')/1024/1024 as size_mb;
   ```

2. **Bandwidth Usage**: Monitor in hosting dashboard
3. **API Calls**: Track in your app
4. **Build Minutes**: Check after each deployment
5. **Active Users**: Implement analytics

## Migration Strategy

1. Start with Netlify + Render free tier
2. Monitor usage metrics weekly
3. When you hit 60% of any limit, plan migration
4. Have data export ready (unlike Airtable):
   ```bash
   pg_dump your_database > backup.sql
   ```

## Cost Comparison Table

| Platform | Free Tier | First Paid Tier | At 10K Users/month |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Netlify + Render | $0 (limited) | ~$14/month | ~$26/month |
| Vercel + Supabase | $0 (limited) | ~$25/month | ~$45/month |
| Railway | $5 credit | ~$10/month | ~$30-50/month |
| Fly.io | $0 (limited) | ~$8/month | ~$20-40/month |
| Self-hosted | N/A | ~$6/month | ~$20/month |

## Action Items

1. Start with Netlify + Render free tier
2. Set up monitoring alerts at 60% of limits
3. Export database backup weekly
4. Track these metrics:
   - Daily active users
   - Database size growth rate
   - API calls per user
   - Bandwidth per user

This way, you'll see limits coming months in advance, unlike the Airtable situation.
