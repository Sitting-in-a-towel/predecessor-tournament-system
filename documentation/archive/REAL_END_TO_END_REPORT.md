## üéØ **THE BOTTOM LINE:**

### **What Works:**
- **Website navigation** is solid
- **Basic page loading** works correctly
- **API backend** is functional (data exists)
- **Authentication flow** initiates properly
- **One form works** (feedback form)

### **What's Broken:**
- **Core tournament functionality** is missing UI
- **Draft system UI** is completely absent  
- **Registration system** not implemented in UI
- **Team management** lacks functional interface
- **Most user interactions** require authentication but UI isn't available

### **Reality Check:**
Your website is a **beautifully designed shell** with **excellent backend data** but **critical UI components are missing or inaccessible**. Users can browse tournaments but cannot interact with the core functionality that makes a tournament management system useful.

## üîß **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

1. **Implement tournament detail tabs** (Overview, Teams, Bracket, etc.)
2. **Create tournament registration interface** 
3. **Build draft system UI** (coin toss, hero selection)
4. **Add team management interface**
5. **Make forms accessible** without full authentication

**Priority:** Fix tournament details and draft UI first - these are core features users expect to work.
