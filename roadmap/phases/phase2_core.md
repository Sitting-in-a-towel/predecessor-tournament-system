## Dependencies
- Phase 1 must be completed
- Airtable database must be set up
- Discord OAuth must be configured

## Testing Requirements
- Complete tournament creation workflow
- Team registration and management workflow
- Admin panel functionality
- API endpoint testing
- Authentication flow testing

## Risk Factors
- Omeda API availability and rate limits
- Discord OAuth configuration complexity
- Airtable API rate limiting for high-usage features

## Success Metrics
- Tournament creation success rate: 95%+
- Team registration completion rate: 90%+
- Admin operations success rate: 98%+
- Page load times under 3 seconds
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
